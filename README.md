audio_generation.py - Summary
Packages: gTTS, pydub, moviepy, os

Functions:

generate_audio_clips(segments, temp_audio_dir): This function generates audio from text using Google’s Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and manipulates the audio with pydub. It applies a speed-up effect to the generated audio, concatenates multiple audio clips, and exports the final audio as an MP3 file. The final audio clip is returned in a format ready for use in video or audio productions via moviepy.
director.py - Summary
Packages: json, requests

Functions:

script(system_prompt, userprompt, url): Sends a POST request to an API with system and user prompts as part of a JSON payload. It processes the response and extracts text content from the API response. This function is used for API-based text generation and returns the generated content.
image_generation.py - Summary
Packages: openai

Functions:

image_generator(prompts): Takes a list of prompts and uses OpenAI’s DALL-E model to generate images. For each prompt, it sends a request to the API and returns the URLs of the generated images, which can be used in further media projects.
main.py - Summary
Packages: director, image_generation, audio_generation, json, os, requests, subprocess, datetime, moviepy

Execution:

This script collects user input and uses it to generate text, images, and audio by calling external modules (script, image_generator, and generate_audio_clips). The results are then combined into a video using moviepy. It automates media generation from textual descriptions, audio narration, and images, compiling them into a final video format.
mlxsd_calling.py - Summary
Packages: os, datetime

Functions:

image_generator(prompts, dir_path): Uses Stable Diffusion to generate images based on prompts. The function constructs and runs command-line commands to generate images from text and returns the output paths of the generated images. It automates image creation by calling an external Python script, making it useful for large-scale media generation tasks.
mlxsd.ipynb - Summary
Functionality:
This notebook creates structured video content using titles and time-based segments for narration and visual prompts. It handles complex media generation tasks by combining text-based prompts and historical narratives with visual prompts, likely generating content such as documentaries or instructional videos. The execution logs show that it generates titles and descriptions for different segments.

test.ipynb - Summary
Functionality:
This notebook is focused on building and writing videos using moviepy and FFmpeg. It handles the creation of video files based on structured segments, blending text, image, and audio elements. The notebook logs video construction steps and exports video outputs to specific paths, using external tools for video encoding and formatting.

tet2.ipynb - Summary
Functionality:
This notebook focuses on video creation, primarily using moviepy and FFmpeg for post-processing. It runs commands to create video-only segments and processes the final output. The notebook is involved in integrating various media components into a cohesive video format, utilizing FFmpeg for handling video compression and file generation.
